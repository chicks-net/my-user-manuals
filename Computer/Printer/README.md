### Star Gemini 10x

The Star Gemini 10x was my very first printer many many moons ago.
All of these years later I still had the printed, spiral-bound user manual.
So I searched to see if anyone had scanned it in, and much to my surprise,
folks had already scanned it in, but their version was different and less
complete than mine.

Obviously I needed to scan mine in.  So I gathered my courage and pried
the pages from the binding.  I ran it through my trusty Brother page feed
scanner and this produced the [raw version](Star_Gemini_10x15x_User_Manual_raw.pdf)
of the manual.  I sent it off to a few places and the maintainer of the
[TRS-80 Color Computer Archive](https://colorcomputerarchive.com/) pointed
out that it didn't look very good.

The criticism that it didn't look good was totally fair, so I looked for a
solution and eventually found an answer on
[SuperUser](https://superuser.com/q/622950/358509) that helped me clean up
the raw version with ImageMagick.  This led the
[brighter version](Star_Gemini_10x15x_User_Manual_brighter.pdf).

The brighter version was an improvement, but not a complete solution.
For one thing it ballooned the file size by 5x for unclear reasons.
And it also didn't totally get rid of the page discoloration that was
most distracting.  But it was the best that I could figure out how to
do, so I sent it back to the fine maintainer of the Color Computer Archive.

Months pass.  Retrocomputing people are either not in a hurry or they are
very busy, but that is beside the point.  After I had stopped looking for any
reply, I heard back.  And they had cleaned up the PDF by hand and produced
[the most glorious version](<https://colorcomputerarchive.com/repo/Documents/Manuals/Hardware/Gemini%2010X-15X%20User's%20Manual%20(Star%20Micronics).pdf>)
yet.  I'm calling this the
[cocoarchive version](Star_Gemini_10x15x_User_Manual_cocoarchive.pdf) and
there is no doubt that it is the best: easiest to read and the smallest
file size yet.  Bravo.
