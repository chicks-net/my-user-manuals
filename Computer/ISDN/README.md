# ISDN: The Future That Almost Was

## What Was ISDN?

[ISDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_Services_Digital_Network)
(Integrated Services Digital Network) was a set of communication standards for
simultaneous digital transmission of voice, video, data, and other network
services over traditional telephone networks. If you're old enough to remember
the screech of a dial-up modem, ISDN was what we thought would save us from
that particular form of torture.

The technology was standardized by the
[ITU-T](https://www.itu.int/en/ITU-T/about/Pages/default.aspx) (International
Telecommunication Union) starting in 1988, though the concepts date back to
the 1960s. Yeah, it took that long.

## The Promise

Back in the early-to-mid 1990s, ISDN was marketed as the telecommunications
revolution. Instead of your pokey 14.4k or 28.8k modem connection, you could
get:

- **BRI (Basic Rate Interface)**: 128 kbps (two 64 kbps B-channels plus one
  16 kbps D-channel)
- **PRI (Primary Rate Interface)**: 1.544 Mbps in North America (T1), 2.048
  Mbps in Europe (E1)

For reference, that 128k BRI connection was about 4.5 times faster than a
28.8k modem. We thought we were living in the future.

The big selling points were:

1. **Digital end-to-end**: No more analog-to-digital conversion losses
2. **Faster call setup**: Connections established in 1-2 seconds versus 30+
   seconds for modems
3. **Multiple services**: Voice and data simultaneously over the same line
4. **Better quality**: Clear digital voice calls

## The Reality

ISDN suffered from what I'll charitably call "implementation challenges":

- **Expensive**: Installation costs were high, monthly fees were ridiculous
- **Complex**: Configuration made setting up X11 look simple
- **Too late**: By the time it rolled out widely, DSL and cable modems were
  already showing up
- **Inconsistent**: Different telcos implemented it differently, leading to
  compatibility nightmares

There's an old joke that ISDN stood for "It Still Does Nothing" or "I Still
Don't Know" or my personal favorite: "Innovations Subscribers Don't Need."

## Where ISDN Actually Mattered

Despite flopping in the consumer market, ISDN found its niche:

- **Broadcast industry**: Remote broadcasting, studio-to-transmitter links
- **Video conferencing**: Before VoIP made it trivial
- **Business trunk lines**: PRI lines for company phone systems (still in use
  at some places!)
- **Point-of-sale systems**: Credit card terminals used ISDN for years

The broadcast use case is particularly interesting - you can read more about

from NPR's coverage back in the day.

## The Legacy

ISDN is mostly dead now, replaced by:

- **VoIP**: Voice over IP for telephony
- **Broadband**: Cable, DSL, fiber
- **SIP trunking**: Modern digital phone service

Many telephone companies finally shut down their ISDN networks in the 2010s
and 2020s. [Germany's Deutsche Telekom](https://www.telekom.com/en/company/details/all-ip-the-network-of-the-future-377086),
for instance, completed their migration away from ISDN to all-IP by 2018.

But ISDN's influence lives on in
[SS7 signaling protocols](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Signalling_System_No._7),
VoIP standards, and the general concept that networks should be digital
end-to-end. It was a stepping stone between the analog telephone network and
the modern internet-based communication systems we use today.
