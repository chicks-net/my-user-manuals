My user manuals

## Organization

Just a bunch of files in directories, which maybe some READMEs.

I have considered other options:

- *Digital Asset Management* - the most popular solutions are PHP based and I just can't do that.
- *Tagging* - there does not seem to be any standard for tagging these files.

So I'm just going to make it up as I go along.
