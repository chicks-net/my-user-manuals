## DT 770 PRO

My desk headphones are beyerdynamic DT 770 PRO's.  I've got the 80 Ohm version.

I was amused at all of the different spec sheets I found for these on the
Internet.  I'm pretty sure they're all official spec sheets from different
vintages of the beyerdynamic marketing department.  So you can share in the
amusement I've included all of the versions I've found here in this directory.
